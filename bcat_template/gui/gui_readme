The gui uses openbabel-2.3.1 to convert a chemdraw .cdxml file into a 3d structure
open babel converts the file and installs H atoms that are not explicitly draw in the cdxml file

The .cdxml file should contain the ligands of interest with the "reactive" atoms
labeled by highlighting them in a color other thank black on the chem draw. 

Any atoms that are charged and deprotonted should be labeled with a charged symbol within the chemdraw.

The gui performs the following procedure
1.  converts cdxml file into xyz file labeled as ligands.xyz
2.  counts number of ligands inside the cdxml file
3.  assigns a charge to each ligand based on the charges labeled on each ligand
4.  identifies the number of atoms in each ligand
5.  identifies which atoms in the ligands.xyz file are considered "reactive"
    - identifies which atoms are highlighted in a color other than black within the ligand.cdxml file
7.  creates ligand directories (1 bcat directory for each ligand in the .cdxml file)
8.  creates the ADD files for each ligand by reading in the labeled atoms and
    then identifying which ligand they belong to.
9.  creates the CHARGE1 file for the ligand charge by reading in the listed charges
10. creates ligand.xyz files for each individual ligand by breaking ligands.xyz into the individual molecules
11. copies all neccessary files to their respective directories. 

If a 'metalCenter.cdxml' file is included it will be used to generate target.xyz and charge files for the metal center
If it is not included then the user needs to MANUALLY add target.xyz and CHARGE2 files into the bcatLigand directory 
to run the M-L binding code. Also double check that the ADD file correctly defines which atoms are being added together
