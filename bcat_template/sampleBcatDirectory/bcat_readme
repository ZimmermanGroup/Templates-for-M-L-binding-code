Notes for running Z conformer search

test.xyz: contains ligand xyz file
target.xyz: contains metal center
CHARGE1: contains charge of test.xyz structure (ligand)
CHARGE2: contains charge of target.xyz structure (metal center)

setupbcat: local variables for python libraries/directories
progress.log: bcat.exe output

conformers only
all.xyz: output file with nonoptimized conformers
all2.xyz: output with semiempirically optimized conformers

For alignments
all3.xyz: alignments of ligand and metal center
all4.xyz: chelated structures
all5.xyz: lowest energy chelated structures

qmake_bcat : creates submision file for conformer search & bcat calcs along with scratch directory 

run.qsh : submision file (use qsub run.qsh)

scratch folder required, without any files in it (generated when qmake_bcat is ran)

for allignment:
target.xyz : contains fixed .xyz of the metal center/molecule you want to add ligands to
ADD : contains atoms to be alligned. listed as ligand atom followed by metal center atom
ex: ligand atoms 5,7 want to be added to the metal center which is atom 1.
ADD file would look as follows

5 1
7 1

alignment runs on OMP_NUM_THREADS squared in run.qsh file (if 16 cores then this should be 4)
