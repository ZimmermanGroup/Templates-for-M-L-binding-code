Readme for files within OPT_DFT folder

1. charge.inp - contains overall charge of M-L complexes
2. end.inp - contains endline for qchem optimization input file
3. sample.inp - contains header for qchem optimization input file
4. bcat_makeDFT - 
     reads in all5.xyz file, splits into each individual molecule
     generates q00X.structureX.inp file for each M-L complex in all5.xyz
5. getOptEnergy -
    grabs the energy from the output files of the qchem runs
    appends them to the file optimized_energies_output_fromqchem.txt
6. makeXYZ -
    generates a folder called xyzFiles
    grabs the xyz coordinates of the optimized structure
    from the output file, and creates xyz files for each structure
